Aggregation is a process in which one class defines another class as any entity reference. 
It is another way to reuse the class. It is a form of association that represents HAS-A relationship.





#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Address
{
    public:
    string city;
    string state;
    Address(string city,string state)
    {
        this->city=city;
        this->state=state;
    }
};
class Engineer
{
   Address *address;
   public:
   string name;int id;
   Engineer(string name,int id,Address *address)
   {
       this->name=name;
       this->id=id;
       this->address=address;
   }
   void display()
   {
       cout<<name<<" "<<id<<" "<<address->city<<" "<<address->state<<endl;
   }
   
};
int main ()
{
    Address a("Guntur","Andhrapradesh");
    Engineer e("Sivakrishnateja",2770,&a);
    e.display();
  return 0;
}
